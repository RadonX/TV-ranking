This is a group project of course _Cloud Computing & Big Data_. My teammate implemented the API which returned TV shows information, ranking and so on. In other word, the required API for the Flask application should be served by another server.

In the Flask folder, `TV.html` and `index.html` are static HTML files for better previewing the Flask application. 

`data-flask` is a simple application which only provides data for `ranking.html`.
